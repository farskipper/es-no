# es-no
A compile to JS language with only **E**ssential **S**yntax and **NO** standard library.

# Essential Syntax

Just a simple lisp/scheme like syntax.

# What?!?! No Standard Library?

Yep, bring your own libraries. Not only can you bring your own functions and objects you can bring your own macros. Thus giving you the full power to express anything in your dialect of this language. Also you can redefine/remove any macro (just like you would a function) thus there are no "reserved" words.

# Disclaimer

Because this language is called "es-no" one may be inclined to think it has something to do with an ECMAScript language version. (i.e. es5 or es6) This may lead one to think that this language is making a statement about ECMAScript. Although that would be interesting, this language makes no statements toward, nor has any affiliation with, ECMAScript or TC39. "es-no" simply means **E**ssential **S**yntax and **NO** standard library.
